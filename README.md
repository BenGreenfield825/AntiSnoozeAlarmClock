# Anti-Snooze Alarm Clock

WIP!!!!

Two-piece hardware that forces the user to walk to another location in the house to punch in a code on a remote unit. The base unit will sound the alarm and generate a code. You need to read the code and physically walk to the remote unit. Once the code is entered into the remote unit, the base unit will stop the alarm.
